 ## Full documentation site

**You can go directly to the complete documentation site about the application and its different versions available.** **[here](https://react-ultimate-messenger-documentation.netlify.app/)**,


## Online Demo sites

**You can try Classic React Ultimate Messenger** **[here](https://react-ultimate-messenger.netlify.app/)**,

(The demo is not fully functional without the server started locally*)


> *you can only send/receive messages if you have the server locally on your machine -
> I explain how to test the online version with your local version further in the documentation...


## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new React App**.

## Generate a new React App by create-react-app tool

Generate a classic React template with **integrated chat**:

create a folder, go to it and open your terminal from this folder of course,

For the moment there is **one line of code to do** before the creation of the React App...
```shell
git clone https://github.com/rodolphe37/cra-react-ultimate-messenger.git
```
After that, you can do the npx command which allows to install a classic React, but with the template option.

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app --template file:../path/to/your/template/folder/you/just/cloned/cra-react-ultimate-messenger
```

## Start your site

***Run the development server:***

go to your folder app
```shell
cd my-app
```

***If you have nvm installed:***

> the chat application requires at least version 12 of Node.js, the nvmrc file is initialized with version 14.15.1. If you have version 12 or higher everything will work fine!
> Otherwise rename the .nvmrc.example file to .nvmrc and then you can change your Node version by simply doing:
> ```shell
> nvm use
> ```

At this stage, you have two lines of code to do:

 * *I made several scripts in the package.json so that everything is automatic!*

The first line is for initializing all servers
```shell
npm run initAll
```
> - This script will first install the necessary node_modules in the messages-images server, then create an images folder (in which the images sent in the chat will be sent), then rename the .env.example file to .env.
> - And finally, he will rename the .env.local.example file to .env.local in the React frontend folder.


And the second line is to start all the services.
```shell
npm run dev
```

  With this single line of code you will start
 > - the server that manages the chat (messages and images) on port 4000,
 > - as well as the classic React frontend on the classic port 3000.


Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

### How to test your local version with the online version!

> * At this level of the tutorial, you have your backend server(s) and your site started and open at the classic address.
> You just have to open in another browser window the demo that corresponds to the version you just installed (link available at the top of the page).
> Then you just have to connect to the same room in both windows and start testing your version.

  ***The left window is the online (prod) version - The right window is your local (dev) version.***
